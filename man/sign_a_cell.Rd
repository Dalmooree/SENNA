\title{Classify spatial spot relative to spline curve}
\usage{
sign_a_cell(df, brk, xcoef, xder, ycoef, yder)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame row representing a single spatial spot with curve parameter `t`, `X1`, `X2`}

\item{brk}{Number of curve segments (internal spline breaks)}

\item{xcoef}{Polynomial coefficients for x(t)}

\item{xder}{Derivatives of x(t)}

\item{ycoef}{Polynomial coefficients for y(t)}

\item{yder}{Derivatives of y(t)}
}
\value{
The input row with additional columns: `region` (1 or -1) and updated `distance` (signed)
}
\description{
Classifies a spatial spot into a binary region (1 or -1) based on its position relative to a spline curve axis (CA).  
Uses the sign of the cross product between the curve tangent and the vector from curve to spot.  
Also negates the Câ€“S distance if the spot lies in region -1.
