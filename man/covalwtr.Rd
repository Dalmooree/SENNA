\title{Plot trimmed curve with lead lines}
\usage{
covalwtr(senna, seed, bg.dot.size, alpha, lead, type, line)
}
\arguments{
\item{senna}{A `SENNA` object containing a trimmed curve}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducible spot sampling}

\item{bg.dot.size}{Size of background dots representing tissue coordinates}

\item{alpha}{Transparency level for background and foreground dots}

\item{lead}{Line width for the lead lines connecting tissue spots to the curve}

\item{type}{Line type (e.g., "longdash") for the lead lines}

\item{line}{Size of the curve axis trace}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object visualizing trimmed curve behavior and spot alignment
}
\description{
Visualize a trimmed curve axis and illustrate alignment between selected tissue spots  
and their projected positions along the curve. Spots with missing curve parameter (`t`)  
are shown in a lighter color to distinguish them from valid points.
