\title{Compute curve parameter and distance for each spot (spline)}
\usage{
covt_roots(spatial, hfun, xcoef, xder, ycoef, yder, trimmed, cores = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{spatial}{A data frame of spatial coordinates}

\item{hfun}{A list of h(t) polynomial terms for each curve segment}

\item{xcoef}{Polynomial coefficients for x(t)}

\item{xder}{Derivatives of x(t)}

\item{ycoef}{Polynomial coefficients for y(t)}

\item{yder}{Derivatives of y(t)}

\item{trimmed}{Logical. Whether the curve is trimmed}

\item{cores}{Number of cores for parallel computation (not supported on Windows)}
}
\value{
A data frame with additional columns: `t` (curve parameter) and `distance` (Euclidean distance to curve)
}
\description{
Computes the curve parameter (t) and Euclidean distance from each spatial spot to the spline-based curve axis (CA).  
Supports both full and trimmed spline curves.
