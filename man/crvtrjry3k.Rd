\title{Generate 3-knot curve trajectory using polynomial coefficients}
\usage{
crvtrjry3k(senna)
}
\arguments{
\item{senna}{A `SENNA` object containing a curve axis with three knots}
}
\value{
A data frame of 2D coordinates sampled along the multi-segment trajectory
}
\description{
Generate a piecewise curve trajectory when the curve axis is defined  
with exactly three knots. Polynomial interpolation is applied to the  
precomputed coefficients to sample dense 2D spatial coordinates.  
Linear extrapolation is supported if the curve is not trimmed.
