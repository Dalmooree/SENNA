\title{Sketch spatial patterns for selected SVGs}
\usage{
\S4method{SketchPatterns}{SENNA}(
  senna,
  genelist = NULL,
  bins = NULL,
  active = FALSE,
  interval = sqrt(2),
  cores = 1L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{senna}{A `SENNA` object}

\item{genelist}{A character vector of genes to analyze. If `NULL`, all progression SVGs are included}

\item{bins}{Number of bins along the curve axis (optional if already binned)}

\item{active}{If `TRUE`, only active spots are used}

\item{interval}{Only values within this distance are included in regression}

\item{cores}{Number of cores for parallel processing}
}
\value{
An object of class `sktS` containing regression patterns and gene labels
}
\description{
Fit bin-wise weighted regression models for genes and extract their spatial trend patterns.  
This function processes each gene's expression profile along the curve axis, optionally within an interval.
}
