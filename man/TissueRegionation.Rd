\title{Binary regionation along curve axis}
\usage{
TissueRegionation(senna, cores = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{senna}{A `SENNA` object with a generated curve axis}

\item{cores}{Number of cores for parallel computation (not supported on Windows)}
}
\value{
A `SENNA` object with updated `Spatial` coordinates including region labels and C–S distance
}
\description{
Performs binary regionation by assigning each spatial spot to one of two regions based on its relative position to the curve axis (CA).  
Also computes the C–S distance (distance from curve axis) for each spot.  
Only supports full curves (not trimmed, except for islet curves).
