\usage{
\S4method{ShowCurve}{SENNA}(
  senna,
  order_label = TRUE,
  color_reference = NULL,
  bg_dot_size = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{senna}{A `SENNA` object with curve axis information}

\item{order_label}{If `TRUE`, show index numbers next to each knot along the curve}

\item{color_reference}{A user-defined reference name pointing to a vector added via `AddReference()`, stored in `Gene$Reference`}

\item{bg_dot_size}{Size of the background tissue points}

\item{bg_dot_alpha}{Transparency of the background tissue points}

\item{colors}{Optional color specification (single color or named vector for manual mapping)}

\item{line_size}{Size of the curve trace line}

\item{line_color}{Color of the curve trace line}

\item{knots_size}{Size of knot points along the curve}

\item{knots_color}{Color of knot points}

\item{text_size}{Text size used for knot index labels (if `order_label = TRUE`)}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object with curve axis and tissue context
}
\description{
Visualize the curve axis and its associated knot points overlaid on the tissue layout.  
If a cell-type annotation is provided via `color_reference`, the tissue background is colored accordingly.
