\title{Sketch spatial patterns for selected SVGs (mSENNA)}
\usage{
\S4method{SketchPatterns}{mSENNA}(
  senna,
  genelist = NULL,
  msR = NULL,
  bins = 4,
  active = FALSE,
  intervals,
  cores = 1L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{senna}{A `mSENNA` object}

\item{genelist}{A character vector of genes to analyze. If `NULL`, all genes are included}

\item{msR}{A reference `msR` object, used to order genes by effect size (optional)}

\item{bins}{Number of bins to divide the curve axis (default = 4)}

\item{active}{If `TRUE`, only active spots are used}

\item{intervals}{A list of cutoff distances for each curve axis, used in weighted regression}

\item{cores}{Number of cores for parallel processing}
}
\value{
An object of class `sktS` containing regression patterns and gene labels
}
\description{
Fit bin-wise weighted regression models across multiple curve axes.  
Each gene's spatial profile is analyzed using a binned and weighted linear model.
