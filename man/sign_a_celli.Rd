\title{Classify spot relative to islet curve axis}
\usage{
sign_a_celli(df, brk, xcoef, xder, ycoef, yder, exd)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A row with spot coordinates and curve parameter}

\item{brk}{Number of internal curve segments}

\item{xcoef}{Coefficients for x(t)}

\item{xder}{Derivatives of x(t)}

\item{ycoef}{Coefficients for y(t)}

\item{yder}{Derivatives of y(t)}

\item{exd}{List containing tangent vectors at start and end of closed curve (`vec1`, `vec2`)}
}
\value{
The input row with region label and possibly signed distance
}
\description{
Assigns region label (1 or -1) based on the spotâ€™s position relative to a closed spline curve axis (islet).  
For edge segments, uses extrapolated tangent vectors and cross-product logic to determine region.
